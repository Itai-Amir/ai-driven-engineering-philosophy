# AI-Driven Engineering Philosophy

This document describes how I use AI across the full software lifecycle — 
from system design and development to testing and operations — 
while keeping production systems stable and deterministic.

## Core Principles

- Production systems must never break
- Prefer simplicity over complex workarounds
- Question architecture before implementation
- Use AI as a practical engineering force multiplier, not a demo

This repository reflects how I actually work in real-world systems,
not theoretical ideas.
